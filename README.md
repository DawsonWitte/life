# life
A recreation of Conway's Game of Life in website form. 
This is technically not Conway's Game of Life because it is not played on an infinite grid.
Instead, the user can change the grid size.

The purpose of this was to practice and improve my JavaScript skills.

Now that this project is fully functional and decently styled, im gonna call this good enough for now. At some point I should style the buttons and either style or make a custom color picker.
I learned a lot making this and it took just about all the knowledge and skill I have right now.
